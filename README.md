# asshole

This is Django + React web service oriented on metagenomics analysis and clinical data collection. It uses Snakemake as a make system for metagenomics data flow. 

It contains partial implementation of openEHR formalism (FINALLY PYTHON!). It will be moved to separate repository later.

Key openEHR components:
* reference model (rm)
* archetype model (am)
* ADL parser
